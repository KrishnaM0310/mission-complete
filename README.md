# Mission Complete - Rocket Focus

**MC - Rocket Focus** is a Chrome Extension that keeps you on-task by detecting distracting websites, blocking them, and offering a Pomodoro timerâ€”all with a fun rocket animation.

## How It Works

### **Set a Goal**
In the popup, enter your mission objective and click **Launch Mission**. The extension starts tracking your tabs.

### **Analysis**
Each time you load or switch tabs, Mission Complete uses its backend, which leverages Gemini, to determine how off-task you might be.

### **Blocking**
If youâ€™re off-task, it automatically redirects or closes the tab.

### **Pomodoro Timer**
- A 25-minute timer you can start, pause/resume, or reset in the popup.
- Continues counting in the backgroundâ€”even if you close the popupâ€”and notifies you when time's up.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Load the unpacked extension in **chrome://extensions** (enable Developer Mode).
3. Run the Backend:

```bash
pip install flask openai
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_KEY"
python backend.py
```

4. Edit `background.js` to call `http://localhost:8080` if needed, or point to your deployed server.

## Usage

1. Open the extension popup, type your goal, and click **Launch Mission**.
2. Use the Pomodoro controls to manage your focus timer.
3. Browse as normal; **Mission Complete** will handle any off-task sites.
4. Enjoy your rocket-powered productivity!
